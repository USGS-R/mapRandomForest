#'This package code and data used to generate estimates of total and baseflow

#'groundwater flow model boundary (Clark and Hart, 2009). This code is heavily adapted
#'from earlier unpublished work by Brian Breaker, formerly of the U.S. Geological
#'Survey. Additional code functions have been adapted from work by other current or
#'former USGS employees including Al Rutledge and Dave Lorenz.
